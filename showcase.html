                <h3>Academic Progression Predictor</h3>
                <p><b>Project Description: Academic Progression Prediction Program</b><br><br>
                    The Academic Progression Prediction Program is a Python-based application designed to help university staff predict the progression outcomes of students at the end of each academic year based on their credit scores in three categories: pass, defer, and fail. This program utilizes user-defined functions for modularity and clarity, making the code easy to read and maintain.<br><br>
                    
                    <b>Key Features:</b><br>
                    <b>User Input:</b> The program prompts the user to input the number of credits for pass, defer, and fail categories. It includes validation to ensure the inputs are integers within specified ranges and sum correctly to 120.<br>
                    <b>Progression Outcomes:</b> Based on the input, the program determines the progression outcome using a predefined set of rules from the university's regulations, such as "Progress," "Module Trailer," "Module Retriever," and "Exclude."<br>
                    <b>Multiple Predictions:</b> Users can input data for multiple students in a loop until they choose to quit, allowing for efficient handling of numerous cases.<br>
                    <b>Histogram Visualization:</b> Upon exiting the loop, the program generates a histogram displaying the count of students in each progression category using the graphics.py module.<br>
                    <b>Data Storage:</b> The program saves the input progression data in a list, allowing for easy access and display of the results.<br>
                    <b>Text File Output:</b> Optionally, the program can save the progression data to a text file for future reference.<br>
